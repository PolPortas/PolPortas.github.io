TARGET USER PROFILE
----------------------------
• The end user, who is going to read the information in this CV, are the companies that are interested in my work or experience, 
  and this, in the end, has to show the Skills that I have programming (because it is a web page).

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------
• Being a CV, all the information has to be well structured and easy to read and I found the essential information easily.
  The structure of my CV shows in large just enter both the image and name, as well as a small description of myself, and 
  education and work experiences.

VISUAL DESIGN
----------------------------
• As a visual design I have decided to focus on a wooden board where bits of paper with all the information are hooked with thumbtacks.
  This is done this way, because my way of seeing, it is that the wooden board is my personal and work life. As I move forward throughout 
  my life, more papers with experiences and skills and languages acquired are attached, making that at the end of my working life, this 
  table manages to be completely full of information and skills that I have been obtaining, making me evolve both as a worker and as a person.

     ○ The sheet with the skills and languages I have opted for a table with two columns, one painted green and the other black, 
       simulating my experience in so many percent I have in each aspect. These tables are all 200px in size and the columns are 
       spread out, as I said, in as many percent of my ability.

CONCLUSION
----------------------------
• In conclusion, all the information has been shown to the public in the most concise and clear way for an easy, fast and suitable reading 
  to see the level and control in each aspect of my person.
